Recognizing individual people from gait is still a challenging problem in computer vision research due to the presence of various covariate factors like varying view angle, change in clothing, walking speed, and load carriage, etc. Most of the earlier works were based on human silhouettes which have proven to be efficient in recognition but are not invariant to change in illumination and clothing. In this research, to address this problem, we present a simple yet effective approach for robust gait recognition using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Our RNN network with GRU architecture is very powerful in capturing the temporal dynamics of the human body pose sequence and perform recognition. We also design a low-dimensional gait feature descriptor based on the 2D coordinates of human pose information which is proven to be not only invariant to various covariate factors but also effective in representing the dynamics of various gait pattern. The experimental results on challenging CASIA A and CASIA B gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on both single-view and cross-view gait recognition which prove the effectiveness of our method.
