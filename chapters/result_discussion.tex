\chapter{Results and Discussions}\label{ch:result_discussion}
This chapter briefly discusses the datasets we used to train and evaluate our model, and the results our proposed algorithm achieved at different experimental setup. As to estimate pose, RGB video frames are required. So, we couldn't evaluate our method to those dataset which only consists of silhouette sequences.

\section{Dataset}
The success of deep learning-based methods greatly depends on the vast amount of labeled train data. Unfortunately, few existing gait databases contain a large number of subjects as well as a variety of covariate factors. Some of the publicly available gait databases are CASIA gait dataset~\cite{Yu_06}, TUM GAID dataset~\cite{Hofmann_14}, OU-ISIR multi-view large population dataset (OU-MVLP)~\cite{Noriko_18} and USF HumanID dataset~\cite{Sarkar_05}. 

In USF HumanID gait dataset, there are $ 122 $ subjects walking outside on two different surfaces of an elliptical path under two different time, viewpoint, clothing, shoes, and carrying conditions. However, not all subjects were filmed under all conditions. TUM GAID dataset is another large dataset for gait recognition which consists of $ 305 $ subjects where each subject has $ 10 $ videos. But this dataset is not suitable for multi-view gait recognition as all the videos were recorded from side view angle. The largest dataset available for gait recognition is OU-ISIR multi-view large population dataset (OU-MVLP). It contains $ 10,307 $ subjects from $ 14 $ view angles ranging from ${{0}^{\circ}-{90}^{\circ}}$, ${{180}^{\circ}-{270}^{\circ}}$. Only two sequences are provided, one for the gallery and the other for the probe. But, this dataset is formatted only as a set of silhouette sequence making it different from our approach.

In this study, we used CASIA (both CASIA A and CASIA B) dataset which is one of the largest multi-view gait databases. CASIA A dataset contains total $ 20 $ subjects walking in an outdoor environment where CASIA B dataset includes total $ 124 $ subjects walking in an indoor environment. In CASIA A gait dataset, each subject walks along a straight line in 3 different view angles lateral (${0^{\circ}}$), oblique (${45^{\circ}}$) and frontal (${90^{\circ}}$). For each viewing angle every subject has four gait sequences of which two of them have same walking direction while the other two have opposite direction. In CASIA B dataset, there are 10 walking sequences of each subject captured from 11 view angles: 6 sequences for normal walking ('nm'), 2 sequences for walking in a coat ('cl') and 2 sequences for walking with bag ('bg') on shoulder. Hence, this dataset separately considered three variations in people walking namely viewing angle, clothing and carrying conditions. The view angle set of the camera is ranging from ${0^{\circ}}$ to ${180^{\circ}}$. Figure~\ref{fig:casia_dataset} illustrates some of the sample video frames of CASIA dataset.

\section{Single-View Gait Recognition}
\subsection{Experimental Evaluation on CASIA-A dataset}
Since, CASIA A dataset contains only $ 20 $ subjects each of which have only four gait sequence in three different angles, we trained three model for each of the gait angle with $ 20 $ output neurons in the final softmax layer of our proposed temporal network. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method on CASIA A dataset, we used leave-one-out cross validation rule, i.e., one sequence was set for testing and the remainder was set for training the network for each view angle. We compare our results with four other prevailing state-of-the-art gait recognition methods including Wang~\cite{Wang_03}, Goffredo~\cite{Goffredo_08}, Liu~\cite{Liu_16}, Lima~\cite{Lima_19}, Kusakunniran~\cite{Kusakunniran_09} (see Figure~\ref{fig:casia_a_result}). Table~\ref{table:casia_a_result} illustrates that the proposed method have achieved higher average correct class recognition rates (\gls{ccr}) $100.0\%$ compared to other methods.

\subsection{Experimental Evaluation on CASIA-B Dataset}
\subsubsection{Experimental Setup}
We designed two experimental setups (A, B) in CASIA B dataset for evaluation. Experiment setup A was for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in single-view gait recognition. To investigate the robustness of view variation, comparison results of the proposed approach against other state-of-the-art methods in different view variations have been reported. Experiment setup B was designed for evaluating the cross-view recognition performance. 

For setup A, as demonstrated in Table~\ref{table:caisab_setup}, we divided the dataset into two groups where the first group which consists of 62 subjects was used to train the network. The second group contains rest of the subjects for evaluating the performance of the model. For setup B, the ratio between train and evaluation set was 24 to 100. In the evaluation set for both setup, 4 normal walking sequences of each subject are put into gallery set and rest 6 walking sequences consist three probe set (\textit{ProbeNM}, \textit{ProbeBG}, \textit{ProbeCL}). \textit{ProbeNM} consists of 2 other normal walking sequences where \textit{ProbeBG} and \textit{ProbeCL} consists of two subjects carrying bag and wearing coat respectively.


We divide CASIA-B dataset into two group where first group consists of 24 subjects and is used to train the network. The second group contains rest 100 subjects that are used to evaluate the performance of the model. In evaluation set, 4 normal walking sequences of each subject are put into gallery set and rest 6 walking sequences consist three probe set (\textit{ProbeNM}, \textit{ProbeBG}, \textit{ProbeCL}). \textit{ProbeNM} consists of 2 other normal walking sequences where 2 subjects carrying bag are kept in \textit{ProbeBG} and remaining 2 subjects wearing coat are kept in \textit{ProbeCL}. Table~\ref{table:caisab_setup} shows this experimental setup.

\subsubsection{Results on Single-View Gait Recognition of CASIA B Dataset without View Variation}
Experimental results of single-view gait recognition on all the three probe set of CASIA B dataset without view variation is illustrated in Table~\ref{table:resutl_without_view}. We achieved higher average recognition rate $ \textbf{97.80\%} $ and $\textbf{82.82\%} $ on the probe set of (\textit{ProbeBG}) and (\textit{ProbeCL}) respectively. This performance proves the robustness of our proposed method towards both carrying and clothing covariate conditions. We also achieved higher average class recognition rate $\textbf{99.41\%}$ on normal walking condition.

\subsubsection{Comparison on Single-View Gait Recognition of CASIA B Dataset with State-of-the-art Methods without View Variation}
We compare our experimental results with other state-of-the-art methods such as GaitGANv2~\cite{Yu_19}, PTSN~\cite{Liao_17}, PoseGait~\cite{Liao_19}, Yu \textit{et al.}~\cite{Yu_17_spae} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:comp_casia_b_without_view}. The experimental setup for all these methods were set A (see Table~\ref{table:caisab_setup}). Table~\ref{table:comp_casia_b_without_view} reports that CCR of the proposed method outperforms all other methods in all three covariate conditions of CASIA-B dataset; our method achieved average CCR of \textbf{93.34\%} with improvement of approx. \textbf{10\%} from PTSN.

\subsubsection{Comparison on Single-View Gait Recognition of CASIA B Dataset with State-of-the-art Methods with View Variation}
To better illustrate the robustness of our gait recognition method to view variation, the proposed method has been compared to three other state-of-the-art methods such as GaitGANv2~\cite{Yu_19}, PoseGait~\cite{Liao_19}, Yu \textit{et al.}~\cite{Yu_17_spae}.  It is observed from Figure~\ref{fig:comp_casia_b_with_view} and Table~\ref{table:comp_casia_b_with_view} comparison that proposed method outperforms other in covariate variation and achieves comparable performance in normal walking. 

Since, to recognize gait, we consider features based on effective body joints, hence our method doesn't get affected by the variation in covariate conditions compared to other appearance-based method or other model-based methods which consider ineffective features to build their gait descriptor. That’s why our method is proven to be less sensitive to view angle variation and performs better in carrying-bag and clothing condition.

\section{Cross-View Gait Recognition}
The gait recognition scheme in which gallery and probe set are getting matched from two different views is commonly known as cross-view gait recognition.

\subsection{Comparison with the State-of-the-art Methods of CASIA B Dataset on Cross-View Gait Recognition}
To show the effectiveness of our method in cross-view recognition, we make the comparison between the proposed method and three other state-of-the-art methods including CNN~\cite{Wu_17}, CMCC~\cite{Kusakunniran_14}, and GEI-SVR~\cite{Kusakunniran_10} with the same experimental setup. The probe angles were selected $0^{\circ}, 54^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}$, and $126^{\circ}$ for comparison. 

Although, the proposed method contains only one model to handle any view angle variation, it achieves comparable performance with other prevailing state-of-the-art methods proposed in literature which were specially designed and trained for cross-view gait recognition. From Table~\cite{table:comp_casia_b_cross_view}, it is seen that CNN~\cite{Wu_17} achieves the highest recognition rates when the view variation is large due to the use of supervised information of all gallery angles during training.


\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Comparison of our proposed method with the previous best results of cross-view gait recognition at different probe angles of CASIA B dataset by \gls{ccr}(\%).

			&$162^{\circ}$ &\textbf{83.0} &75.0 &74.0 &77.0 \\\hline
	\end{tabular*}}{} 
\end{table}

The comparison in Table~\ref{table:comp_casia_b_cross_view} also illustrates that the proposed method performs better when the view variation is small. The reason for not achieving better performance at large view variation is because it was trained with only one viewing angle.  



%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\section{Multi-View Gait Recognition}
In multi-view gait recognition, multiple views of gallery gaits are combined to recognize probe set for an unknown gait view. In our work, for multi-view gait recognition, we trained a two-stage network in which we initially identify the walking direction of a gait video using a 3D-CNN network.

\subsection{Comparison with the State-of-the-art Methods on Multi-View Gait Recognition}
We tested the proposed 3D-CNN network with all three probe set of CASIA-B dataset and have achieved \textbf{100\%} identification accuracy in all viewpoint angles proving the fact that our 3D-CNN is efficient in classifying walking direction from gait videos. Table~\ref{table:result_wd_identification} illustrates our test result.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed two-stage network, we compare it with the recent state-of-the-art multi-view gait recognition methods such as Dupuis~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Dupuis_13}, Isaac~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Isaac_17}, and VI-MGR~\cite{Choudhury_15} on all three probe set of CASIA-B dataset. The comparison, as illustrated in Table~\ref{table:comp_multi_view} and Fig.~\ref{fig:comp_casia_b_multi_view}, shows that the proposed method exceeds the previous best in result all three probe set by a significant margin. It outperforms other in $ \textbf{8} $ of $ 11 $ total probe angles.
