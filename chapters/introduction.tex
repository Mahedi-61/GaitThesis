\section{Person Re-identification}
In recent years, with the increasing demand for public safety and security, the network of video surveillance cameras are proliferating in both public and private areas. In order to reduce the number of crimes and terror attacks, and to provide a safer and secure environment, it is necessary to improve the current state of the surveillance system by implementing computer vision-based algorithms to automatically recognize a suspicious person. However, unfortunately, existing surveillance systems only have the capacity to capture and store the video leaving the task of detecting abnormal events in human operators. Therefore, there has been a great effort by the computer vision and artificial intelligence (\gls{ai}) communities to develop an intelligent video surveillance system capable of real-time monitoring and alerting. Person re-identification (\gls{reid}), a fundamental task of intelligent video surveillance system, refers to recognizing the same person across a network of cameras with non-overlapping fields of view from the given single or multiple images. Besides security and surveillance, it is needed for a lot of applications such as authentication, human-computer interaction, cross-camera person tracking, human behavior, and activity analysis. 

A basic person re-identification scenario can be shown in Figure~\ref{fig:person_reid}. In a surveillance system person \gls{reid} helps us to know when and where a person appears with respect to a given camera, and in a network of multiple cameras. It potentially allows us to estimate his/her trajectory over a short period of time. 

However, person \gls{reid} remains an open problem to be addressed in real-time surveillance due to the large variation in camera view angle, pose and illumination variation, partially or complete occlusions, and subject intrinsic variations. However, among these, the viewpoint variation is one of the most challenging problems which simultaneously creates the intra-class variation and the inter-class confusion.

\section{Gait Recognition}
\subsection{Definition}
Biometrics refers to the automatic identification or authentication of people by analyzing their physiological and behavioral characteristics. Physiological biometrics is related to the shape of body parts such as the face, fingerprints, shape of the hand, iris, retina, etc., which are not subject to change due to aging. It is now used as the most stable means for authenticating and identifying people in a reliable way. However, for efficient and accurate authentication, these traits require cooperation from the subject along with a comprehensive controlled environmental setup. Therefore, these traits are not useful in surveillance systems. Behavioral biometrics such as signatures, gestures, gait, and voice, etc., is related to a personâ€™s behavior. But, these traits are more prone to change depending on factors such as aging, injuries, or even mood. 

\textit{Gait} can be defined as the coordinated, cyclic combination of movements that result in human locomotion~\cite{Boyd_05}. The movements of gait are coordinated in the sense that they must occur with a specific temporal pattern and cyclic in nature since a walker cycles between steps with alternating feet. It is both the coordinated and cyclic nature of the motion that makes gait a unique phenomenon for each individual. Although these movements follow the same basic bipedal pattern for all humans, they seem to vary from one person to another considerably in their relative timing and magnitudes~\cite{Benabdelkader_02}.

\textit{Gait recognition} is a behavioral biometric modality that identifies a person based on his/her gait pattern. Among the behavioral biometrics cues, gait is very relevant to person \gls{reid} in surveillance networks. It is the most prevalent human movement in typical surveillance spaces. 


\subsection{Advantages}
In contrast to other biometrics such as face and fingerprint, gait has several attractive properties. For example, it is a non-invasive technique for identifying an individual which is hard to copy. It doesn't require any cooperation or awareness of the subject. Another unique advantage of gait as a biometric is that it offers recognition at a greater distance with a simple instrument. Additionally, recognition can also be done reliably at low-resolution images. Other biometrics may not provide the required accuracy under these conditions. Due to these potential advantages, gait has attracted significant attention in recent years.

\subsection{Challenges}
It has been observed that some recent gait recognition algorithms have achieved $100\%$ classification accuracy under controlled environmental setup. However, these results significantly degrade in real-world scenarios due to the presence of various covariate factors. Due to these covariate factors, gait recognition in a real-world multi-camera environment remains an open research problem that yet prevent it to be employed in public places for surveillance-based applications. 

Gait recognition is highly affected by the change in environment such as variations in view angle, illumination, and walking surface as well as different intraclass variations such as variation in clothing and carrying condition. Some of the challenging factors and their effects are explained in following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{View angle variation}: Since with the variation of camera position the distance between the subject and the camera as well as the walking direction of the subject are varying, different sizes or shapes of the subject can be observed in different viewing angles. Moreover, one view can contain partial information of subject's body pose. Even some the body parts of the subject are not visible in one view angle, but could be visible in another view angle. Furthermore, in same view angle different people's shape may look more similar compare to the shape of same subject under different view angle. 
	
	\item \textbf{Partial occlusion}: Sometimes subjects are partially or completely occluded by overlapping with other people or objects. 
	
	\item \textbf{Low resolution}: Surveillance cameras are usually installed in high places on walls which are far away from the subject. Therefore, the captured videos are in low resolution which often cause inaccurate body pose estimation.
	
	\item \textbf{Clothing or carrying variation}: The subject may appear with different clothing and carrying object in different camera views. For example, subject may wear a coat or take the backpack in hand from back.
	
	\item \textbf{Illumination variation}: In a network of multiple camera illumination condition can vary. Therefore, the same subject can have a color difference on the appearance under different lighting conditions. 
\end{itemize}

Some of the examples images illustrating these challenges are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gait_challenges}. So, these challenges are needed to be addressed for robust gait recognition.



\section{Problem Definition}
Gait-based person re-identification in surveillance is a problem of recognizing individuals based on their gait pattern at different times and locations from a network of interconnected cameras without overlapping views. However, the presence of various covariate factors make the problem very challenging. Although a multitude of researches have been done in recent years, it remains an open problem and many of its aspects have yet to be addressed. This research aims to  build a robust algorithm to address these challenges. It also investigates ways to incorporate the multi-view data to solve the problem of view-dependency in multi-camera network.


\section{Motivations}
The type of person re-identification is fundamentally different between normal applications and surveillance-based applications. For normal person \gls{reid}, the operator has control over most of the acquisition factors, e.g., camera viewpoint, the number of persons in the image, chance of occlusion, subject pose, and illumination, etc. On the other hand, in person \gls{reid} under a real-world surveillance system, most of these conditions are uncontrolled, e.g., changes in viewpoint and illumination over a large number of cameras, no control on the number of people, and possible occlusions, etc. Therefore, due to the unconstrained nature of the problem, gait recognition algorithm is now considered as the only likely identification technology in real-world video-based surveillance applications~\cite{Lee_14}.

Consequently, in recent years, it has been widely investigated in covert video surveillance for security, criminal investigation, and forensic analysis where surveillance cameras have been employed. For example, digital video footage from subway stations, airports, shopping mall, or other public places can be analyzed to identify the suspects of an unexpected event. Gait signature can also be implemented to serve as identity verification for access control or criminology. Here the method is not vulnerable to spoofing attacks and signature forgery. 

In addition to the authentication applications, gait analysis can also be used in medical applications for abnormality detection, Parkinson's disease~\cite{Michele_17}, and Chronic disease~\cite{Juen_14}. Early detection of these types of disorders by motion analysis can be very helpful for the treatment of such diseases.




\section{Objectives of the Thesis}
The objective of this thesis is to design a gait recognition method for person \gls{reid} in a multi surveillance camera environment. To achieve this objective, we have identified the following specific aims.

\begin{itemize}
\item To design a novel low-dimensional gait feature descriptor based on the pose information of the people detected in the gait videos. 

\item To develop a robust pose-based gait recognition algorithm using recurrent neural network (RNN), which will be invariant to factors like view angle, clothing, presence of bags, etc.

\item To identify people across a set of interconnected surveillance cameras.
\item To compare the results with state-of-the-art methods.
\end{itemize}



\section{Contributions}
Original contributions resulting from the research presented in this thesis are fourfold:
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce a novel low-dimensional discriminative gait feature vector from the 2D body pose information which is invariant to covariate factors and achieved comparable performance to the methods which require to calculate gait energy image (GEI) or expensive 3D poses for gait descriptors.

\item We design a novel \gls{rnn} network with \gls{gru} architecture and devise several strategies to effectively train the network for robust gait recognition. 

\item We also propose a two-stage network for multi-view gait recognition in which we first identify the walking direction using a 3D convolutional network and then performs subject recognition using a temporal network trained on that view angle.

\item The proposed pose-based \gls{rnn} network achieves the best results on two challenging benchmark datasets CASIA A and CASIA B~\cite{Yu_06} by outperforming other prevailing methods in both single-view and multi-view gait recognition at a significant margin.
