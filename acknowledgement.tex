First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to my supervisor Dr.\ Hossen Asiful Mustafa, who is a great mentor leading me to the research field of computer vision and deep learning. Without his great help and invaluable guidance I would hardly finish this dissertation. I could not have imagined having better supervisors and mentors for my master thesis research.

We would like to sincerely thank Md. Arifuzzaman and Md. Shazibul Islam Shamim, who have previously worked in this particular field and shared the primitive study materials and gave effective guidelines whenever we needed. The level of patience and time given by them is really praiseworthy.

Finally, I want to dedicate the essence of our purest respect to our parents who have made my existences possible. They always believed in me even at the moment when i were losing our believes in ourselves. It is not really i who reached here but of course it is our kind parents who gave me hope and inspiration.
